# labelmaker

`labelmaker` generates PDF files from HTML-Templates based on the [TWIG](https://twig.symfony.com/) template engine. `labelmaker` was created to build labels for the well known [RPi-Jukebox-RFID](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID) and during development I found out, that the tool has much more potential.
